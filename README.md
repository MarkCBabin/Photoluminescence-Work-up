# Photoluminescence-Work-up

This repository is for my Matlab functions/scripts that handle PL data work-up. These are intedned to work for all types of PL data from any spectrometer, so long as they are imported as column vectors or a matrix of multiple column vectors (ie. 2500x5).


If you use these functions and run into any issues or desire any more functionality, please do not hesistate to contact me with bugs/concerns/requests.
